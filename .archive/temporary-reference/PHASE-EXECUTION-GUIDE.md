## Overview

As a development AI assistant executing a specific phase of a larger project, your role is to:
- **Educate** - Explain the phase thoroughly
- **Plan** - Create a clear implementation strategy
- **Execute** - Build and test the implementation
- **Verify** - Ensure all criteria are met
- **Never commit** - Wait for explicit user approval before committing code
- **Support bug handling** - Follow the bug process defined in this guide (ensure log exists, ask about bugs at phase end, support bug review and Phase Bug*n* creation and execution)

---

## Pre-Execution: Phase Analysis

Before beginning execution:

### Step 0: Ensure Bugs and Issues Log exists

- Confirm that **Bugs and Issues Log** exists at `docs/implementation/bugs-and-issues-log.md`.
- If it has never been created for this project, create it by following **How to create the Bugs and Issues Log** in this guide (that section defines the full file structure; do not use `bugs-and-issues-log.md` as a reference for creation).

### Phase type

- **Normal phase** (e.g. PHASE-001.1, PHASE-018): Read the full phase specification from `implementation-plan.md` and proceed with Phase Education below.
- **Bug-fix phase** (e.g. PHASE-BUG-001): This is a bug-fix phase. Load the phase content from the **Bug-fix phases** section of `implementation-plan.md` and the corresponding bug entry in `docs/implementation/bugs-and-issues-log.md`. Use that as the phase specification for Phase Education, Game Plan, Checklist, Definition of Done, and Test Coverage (same structure as a normal phase; scope comes from the bug).

### 1. Phase Education

Provide a comprehensive explanation covering:

#### What
- **Purpose**: What is this phase trying to achieve?
- **Scope**: What is included and explicitly excluded?
- **Context**: How does this phase fit into the overall project?

#### How
- **Approach**: High-level technical approach
- **Architecture**: How components fit together
- **Patterns**: Design patterns or conventions being used

#### Dependencies
- **Prerequisites**: Which previous phases must be complete?
- **External dependencies**: Tools, services, or libraries required
- **Blocking dependencies**: What cannot proceed without this phase?

#### Key Deliverables
- **Code artifacts**: Files, modules, components to be created
- **Configuration**: Config files, environment setup
- **Documentation**: Comments, README updates, API docs
- **Tests**: Test files and test coverage

---

### 2. Game Plan

Provide a clear, step-by-step implementation plan:

#### High-Level Approach and Strategy
- **Architecture decisions**: How will components be structured?
- **Technology choices**: Why specific tools/libraries are selected
- **Integration strategy**: How this phase integrates with existing code
- **Risk mitigation**: Known challenges and how to address them

#### Order of Operations
- **Dependency order**: What must be built first?
- **Logical sequence**: Step-by-step build order
- **Parallel work**: What can be done simultaneously?
- **Critical path**: What blocks other work?

#### Key Technical Decisions and Rationale
- **Design patterns**: Why specific patterns are chosen
- **API design**: Endpoint structure, request/response formats
- **Data modeling**: Schema decisions, relationships
- **Error handling**: How errors are handled and reported
- **Security considerations**: Authentication, authorization, data protection

#### Integration Points with Existing Code
- **APIs to consume**: Which existing endpoints/services are used?
- **Shared components**: Reusable code, utilities, helpers
- **Database migrations**: How schema changes are applied
- **Configuration**: Environment variables, properties files
- **Testing infrastructure**: How tests integrate with existing test suite

---

## Execution Workflow

Follow this workflow exactly for every phase:

### Step 1: Wait for Go/No-Go (or run bug review if requested)

If the user has asked to **review bugs** (e.g. "I'd like to review the bugs in the bugs-and-issues-log and decide if any should be fixed before we proceed"), follow the **Bug review and bug-fix phase workflow** in the section below instead of starting a normal phase. Otherwise, proceed as follows.

After providing the Phase Education, Game Plan, Implementation Checklist, Definition of Done, and Test Coverage Requirements:

1. **Present the information** clearly and comprehensively
2. **Ask explicitly**: "Ready to proceed? Please respond with 'go' or 'no-go'"
3. **Wait for user response** - Do not proceed until user explicitly says "go"

**If user says "no-go":**
- Address any concerns or questions
- Revise the plan if needed
- Present updated information and wait again

---

### Step 2: Create Branch (if user says "go")

When user says "go":

1. **Create branch** using naming convention: `feature/{phase-id-short-name}`
   - Example: `feature/phase-0-foundation`
   - Example: `feature/phase-1-1-db-core-platform`
   - Example: `feature/phase-2-security-baseline`
   - Example (bug-fix phase): `feature/phase-bug-1-practitioner-reactivate` or `feature/phase-bug-001`

2. **Confirm branch creation**:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/{phase-id-short-name}
   git branch  # Show current branch
   ```

3. **Verify**: Confirm the branch name and that you're on the correct branch before proceeding

---

### Step 3: Execute Implementation

Implement all items from your checklist:

#### Implementation Steps
1. **Create project structure** (if needed)
   - Directories, files, basic scaffolding

2. **Add dependencies** (if needed)
   - Update `pom.xml`, `package.json`, etc.
   - Install dependencies

3. **Write code**
   - Implement all features from checklist
   - Follow project conventions
   - Add appropriate comments

4. **Write tests**
   - Unit tests
   - Integration tests
   - E2E tests (if applicable)

5. **Fix linting errors**
   - Run linters
   - Fix all errors and warnings
   - Ensure code style compliance

6. **Verify build succeeds**
   - Run build commands
   - Fix any build errors
   - Ensure clean build

7. **Run all tests**
   - Execute test suite
   - Fix failing tests
   - Ensure all tests pass

8. **Verify test coverage**
   - Check coverage reports
   - Ensure coverage meets requirements
   - Document coverage percentage

#### Quality Gates
- ✅ All code written and functional
- ✅ All tests written and passing
- ✅ No linting errors
- ✅ Build succeeds
- ✅ Test coverage meets requirements

---

### Step 4: Provide Manual Test Plan

After implementation is complete, provide a detailed manual test plan:

#### Setup Instructions
- **Prerequisites**: What must be running/configured
- **Environment setup**: How to prepare test environment
- **Database setup**: How to seed test data (if needed)
- **Start services**: Commands to start API, frontend, etc.

#### Test Scenarios

For each scenario, provide:

1. **Test ID/Name**: Unique identifier
2. **Description**: What is being tested
3. **Prerequisites**: Setup required
4. **Steps**: Detailed step-by-step instructions
5. **Expected Result**: What should happen
6. **Actual Result**: (Leave blank for tester to fill)
7. **Pass/Fail**: (Leave blank for tester to fill)

#### Test Categories
- **Happy path**: Normal, successful operations
- **Error cases**: Invalid inputs, error conditions
- **Edge cases**: Boundary conditions, unusual scenarios
- **Integration**: Cross-component interactions
- **Security**: Authentication, authorization, RBAC
- **Performance**: Response times, load handling (if applicable)

#### Browser/Device Testing (for UI phases)
- **Browsers**: Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge
- **Devices**: Desktop, tablet, mobile (if applicable)
- **Screen sizes**: Responsive design verification

#### Edge Cases to Consider
- Empty/null inputs
- Invalid data formats
- Concurrent operations
- Network failures
- Timeout scenarios
- Large datasets
- Permission boundaries

---

### Step 4.5: Ask about bugs before requesting approval (before commit)

Before presenting the approval summary (Step 5) and before any commit, ask the user:

*"Is there any need to track any bugs or issues before moving on to the next phase?"*

- If the user says **yes**, add each bug or issue to `docs/implementation/bugs-and-issues-log.md` using the log format (see that document), and set **Phase when added** to the current phase ID (e.g. PHASE-018).
- Then continue to Step 5 (Request Approval).

---

### Step 5: Request Approval

Present a comprehensive summary:

#### Summary of What Was Built
- **Features implemented**: List all features completed
- **Files created**: List new files with brief descriptions
- **Files modified**: List modified files with brief descriptions
- **Dependencies added**: New libraries/packages
- **Configuration changes**: Environment variables, config files

#### Test Results
- **Unit tests**: X passed, Y failed (must be all passed)
- **Integration tests**: X passed, Y failed (must be all passed)
- **E2E tests**: X passed, Y failed (if applicable, must be all passed)
- **Test coverage**: X% (must meet requirements)
- **Test execution command**: How to run tests
- **Test output**: Key test results or link to test report

#### Manual Test Plan
- Reference the manual test plan provided in Step 4
- Note any special instructions or prerequisites

#### Approval Request
- **Explicit statement**: "All implementation is complete. All tests pass. Ready for review."
- **DO NOT COMMIT**: Explicitly state "I have NOT committed any code. Waiting for your approval."
- **Wait for explicit approval**: User must say "approved" or "commit" before committing

#### What NOT to Do
- ❌ Do NOT commit code automatically
- ❌ Do NOT skip tests
- ❌ Do NOT proceed if tests fail
- ❌ Do NOT commit without explicit user approval

---

## Post-Approval: Commit and Merge

**Only after user explicitly says "approved" or "commit":**

1. **Stage changes**:
   ```bash
   git add .
   ```

2. **Commit with descriptive message**:
   ```bash
   git commit -m "feat: [Phase ID] [Phase Name] - [Brief description]

   - [Key feature 1]
   - [Key feature 2]
   - [Key feature 3]
   
   Implements: [Phase ID from implementation-plan.md]
   Traceability: [FR/FS references if applicable]
   ```

3. **Confirm commit**: Show commit hash and summary

4. **Ask about merge**: "Would you like me to merge this branch, or will you handle it?"

---

## Bug review and bug-fix phase workflow

When the user asks to **review bugs** and decide what to fix (e.g. "I'd like to review the bugs in the bugs-and-issues-log and decide if any should be fixed before we proceed"):

### Review cycle

1. Read `docs/implementation/bugs-and-issues-log.md`.
2. For each bug entry (Bug #1, Bug #2, …), present a short summary to the user and ask: *"Do you want to fix this bug (Bug #x) before proceeding?"*
3. Cycle through all listed bugs so the user can indicate which (if any) they want to fix.

### Creating Phase Bug*n* (when user says they want to fix bug *x*)

1. Generate a full **Phase Bug*n*** (e.g. Phase Bug1 for Bug #1) with the **same structure as a normal phase** in this guide: Phase Identity (Phase ID e.g. `PHASE-BUG-001`, Phase Name, FR Mapping), Goal, Dependencies, Plan, Outcome, Automated Verification (AI Gate), Human Verification (Human Gate), Success Criteria, Traceability (if applicable). Derive content from the bug entry in the bugs-and-issues-log and from the requirements/solution docs it references.
2. **Do not** add the phase to `implementation-plan.md` yet. Output the full Phase Bug*n* content **in chat** and say: *"I'm about to add the following phase to the implementation plan for your approval. Please review and tell me if you approve or what you'd like changed."*
3. Only after the user **approves**, add the phase to the **Bug-fix phases** section of `docs/implementation/implementation-plan.md` and add a line to the **Phase index** under "Bug-fix phases" (e.g. **Phase Bug1** — Bug fix: Bug #1 — [short name]).
4. Ask: "Phase Bug*n* is now in the plan. Do you want to execute Phase Bug*n* now, or proceed to the next regular phase?"

**This section is the source of truth for the bug process.** The implementation plan only stores the resulting Phase Bug*n* entries; it does not define the workflow.

### How to create the Bugs and Issues Log

Use this section when creating `docs/implementation/bugs-and-issues-log.md` for the first time. The guide is the source of truth; do not look at an existing `bugs-and-issues-log.md` to learn the format.

**File path:** `docs/implementation/bugs-and-issues-log.md`

**Document structure to create:**

1. **Title and purpose** (first lines of the file):
   - `# Bugs and Issues Log`
   - One paragraph: This document records bugs and issues found during testing. Items are logged for later remediation; **do not fix at log time**. Each entry includes a short analysis of where the issue likely resides and which requirements/solution documents are impacted.

2. **Conventions** (bulleted list):
   - **Impact type**: *Missed/new requirement* = capability was never specified or implemented. *Badly implemented requirement* = requirement exists but implementation is incomplete or wrong.
   - **Where it resides**: Backend (API/service), Frontend (web UI), or both; plus specific docs if useful.
   - **Phase when added**: The phase during which the bug was identified and logged (e.g. the phase under verification or in progress when the issue was found). Use the Phase ID (e.g. PHASE-017). See `docs/implementation/implementation-plan.md` for the phase index.
   - **Status**: Default is **new**. Allowed values: **new**, **to do**, **priority**, **hold**, **fixed**. When status is set to **fixed**, set **Fixed date** to the current date (YYYY-MM-DD).
   - **Fixed date**: Default is empty. When **Status** is set to **fixed**, set this to the current date (YYYY-MM-DD).

3. **Log format (per entry)** — show the template for one entry:
   - **Status**: Default is **new**. Allowed values: **new**, **to do**, **priority**, **hold**, **fixed**. When status is set to **fixed**, set **Fixed date** to the current date (YYYY-MM-DD).
   - **Fixed date**: Default is empty. When **Status** is set to **fixed**, set this to the current date (YYYY-MM-DD).
   - Table header row: `| # | Date found | Found by | Summary | Phase when added | Status | Fixed date |`
   - Table separator: `|---|------------|----------|---------|------------------|--------|------------|`
   - Table example row: `| (number) | YYYY-MM-DD | (name) | One-line description | Phase ID (e.g. PHASE-017) | new | |`
   - **Analysis** section with bullets: **Where the issue likely resides** (backend / frontend / both; components or layers); **Requirements/solution docs impacted** (list with paths); **Impact type** (Missed/new requirement | Badly implemented requirement); **Notes** (optional clarification).
   - One sentence: Record **Phase when added** as the phase during which the bug was identified and logged. New entries use **Status** default **new** and **Fixed date** empty; when a bug is resolved, set **Status** to **fixed** and **Fixed date** to the current date.

4. **Entries** section:
   - Heading: `## Entries`
   - For each bug, a subheading `### Bug #n` and the table + Analysis as above.
   - At the end: a line such as *Add new entries below using the same format. Increment the bug number for each new entry.*

When **adding a new entry** to an existing log, use the same per-entry format (Bug #n heading, table with #, Date found, Found by, Summary, Phase when added, Status, Fixed date, then **Analysis** with Where the issue likely resides, Requirements/solution docs impacted, Impact type, Notes). Always set **Phase when added** to the current phase ID. Set **Status** to **new** and **Fixed date** to empty for new entries. When a bug is resolved, set **Status** to **fixed** and **Fixed date** to the current date (YYYY-MM-DD).

## Phase Completion Checklist

Before marking a phase as complete, verify:

- [ ] All code implemented per checklist
- [ ] All tests written and passing
- [ ] Test coverage meets requirements
- [ ] No linting errors
- [ ] Build succeeds
- [ ] Manual test plan provided
- [ ] **Bug capture**: Before requesting approval (Step 4.5), asked user "Is there any need to track any bugs or issues before moving on to the next phase?" and, if yes, logged entries in `bugs-and-issues-log.md` with **Phase when added**
- [ ] User has approved
- [ ] Code committed (if user approved)
- [ ] Phase status updated in `phase-status.md` (if applicable)
- [ ] **Bug-fix phases**: If the user requested a bug review and approved a Phase Bug*n*, that phase was added to `implementation-plan.md` (Bug-fix phases section and Phase index)

---

## Notes

- **Always read the full phase specification** before starting
- **Follow the implementation plan** - don't skip ahead or add features not in scope
- **Maintain traceability** - link code to requirements where applicable
- **Document decisions** - comment on non-obvious choices
- **Keep commits atomic** - one logical change per commit
- **Test thoroughly** - better to catch issues early
- **Communicate clearly** - explain what you're doing and why
- **Bug handling** - Ensure the bugs log exists; ask about bugs at phase end (Step 4.5) **before requesting approval/commit**. Follow the bug review and bug-fix phase workflow in this guide when the user requests it. This guide is the source of truth for the bug process.

## Example Phase Execution Flow

```
1. AI: [Provides Phase Education, Game Plan, Checklist, DoD, Test Coverage]
2. AI: "Ready to proceed? Please respond with 'go' or 'no-go'"
3. User: "go"
4. AI: [Creates branch feature/phase-0-foundation]
5. AI: [Implements all checklist items]
6. AI: [Provides Manual Test Plan]
7. AI: [Step 4.5: Asks "Is there any need to track any bugs or issues before moving on?"]
8. AI: [Requests approval with summary]
9. User: "approved"
10. AI: [Commits code]
11. AI: [Confirms completion]
```

---

## Example: Bug review and Phase Bug1

```
1. User: "I'd like to review the bugs in the bugs-and-issues-log and decide if any should be fixed before we proceed."
2. AI: [Reads bugs-and-issues-log.md; for each bug: summary + "Do you want to fix this bug (Bug #x)?"]
3. User: "Yes, fix bug 1."
4. AI: [Generates full Phase Bug1 in chat] "I'm about to add this phase to the implementation plan for your approval. Please review and tell me if you approve or what you'd like changed."
5. User: "Approved."
6. AI: [Adds Phase Bug1 to implementation-plan.md Bug-fix phases section and Phase index]
7. AI: "Phase Bug1 is now in the plan. Do you want to execute Phase Bug1 now, or proceed to the next regular phase?"
```

**Executing Phase Bug1** then follows the same execution workflow as any other phase (Go/No-Go → Create branch `feature/phase-bug-1-...` → Implement → Manual Test Plan → Step 4.5 → Request Approval → Commit after approval).

---

**This guide is the canonical reference for phase execution. Follow it consistently for every phase.**
