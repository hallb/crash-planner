# Phase Refactoring Checklist

Use this checklist when creating or refactoring a phase to ensure it follows the Canonical SDLC Phase Shape.

## Phase Structure Checklist

- [ ] **Phase Identity** section exists
  - [ ] Phase ID is unique and sequential (e.g., `PHASE-002`)
  - [ ] Phase Name is descriptive
  - [ ] FR Mapping lists explicit FRs (or "None (foundational)")

- [ ] **Goal** section exists
  - [ ] Describes system state (not effort)
  - [ ] Uses present tense ("The system can...")
  - [ ] Is specific and measurable

- [ ] **Dependencies** section exists
  - [ ] Lists Phase IDs (e.g., `PHASE-001`)
  - [ ] Or states "None" if no dependencies

- [ ] **Plan** section exists
  - [ ] Contains step-by-step instructions
  - [ ] Uses action verbs (create, implement, configure)
  - [ ] Specific enough for blind execution

- [ ] **Outcome** section exists
  - [ ] Lists measurable deliverables
  - [ ] Uses bullet points
  - [ ] Each outcome is verifiable

- [ ] **Automated Verification (AI Gate)** section exists
  - [ ] Lists specific test/verification steps
  - [ ] Includes "Expected:" results
  - [ ] Executable by CI/CD

- [ ] **Human Verification (Human Gate)** section exists
  - [ ] Lists review steps requiring judgment
  - [ ] 2-4 items maximum
  - [ ] Focuses on intent/alignment

- [ ] **Success Criteria** section exists
  - [ ] Uses ✅ checkboxes
  - [ ] Binary criteria (done/not done)
  - [ ] 4-8 items maximum
  - [ ] Each independently verifiable

## Quality Checks

- [ ] All 8 sections present and in correct order
- [ ] No section is empty or placeholder
- [ ] FR mappings match Functional Requirements document exactly
- [ ] Dependencies reference valid Phase IDs
- [ ] Phase can be executed independently (dependencies satisfied)
- [ ] Phase represents 1-2 weeks of work (not too large/small)

## Quick Reference

**Sections (in order):**
1. Phase Identity
2. Goal
3. Dependencies
4. Plan
5. Outcome
6. Automated Verification (AI Gate)
7. Human Verification (Human Gate)
8. Success Criteria

**FR Mapping:**
- Required for all non-foundational phases
- Use exact FR IDs from requirements document
- Foundational phases: `FR Mapping: None (foundational)`

**Goal Format:**
- ✅ "The system can [do something]"
- ❌ "Implement [something]"

**Plan Format:**
- ✅ "Create `table_name` table with constraints"
- ❌ "Set up tables"

**Verification Format:**
- ✅ "Integration tests for `/api/endpoint` return 200"
- ❌ "Test the endpoint"
